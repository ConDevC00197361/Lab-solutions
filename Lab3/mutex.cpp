 * \subsection info_sec Lab 3 - Description
 * The main method creates fived threads and four of them will call the mutexOne and the mutexTwo functions.#
 * In those two functions each thread will goes through in the loop ten times and increase the shared variable
 * value by one. The last thread only will call the printShared Variable function, which is displaying the 
 * shared variable value changed by the threads. The size of the loop can be changed in the mutex functions
 * and that will increase of decrease the shared variable value.
 * Debug function added to the makefile. to use debugger: 
 * 1. open terminal
 * 2. navigate to the folder where mutex lab is created
 * 3. Type in : gdb mutex  - to start the debugger function.
 * The Makefile runs the Doxygen to generate the documentation when the project build
