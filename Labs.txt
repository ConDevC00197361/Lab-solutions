Create a project on your github account. Call this proeject CDDLabs
In this project create on folder for each Lab sheet.  i.e. Lab1, Lab2, Lab3, etc.
Each folder will include a folder called docs.  All generated Doxygen files will be created inside this directory.

Lab One – Signalling with Semaphores

You will need to create five files for this lab.
Two containing the Semaphore class declaraation and definition:
Semaphore.h
Semaphore.cpp
One file for the main function that shows signaling in action.  This main function must create at least two threads where one thread signals the other using a common Semaphore.  This file should be named: signal.cpp
The fourth file is called Makefile and will contain one rule that compiles the code and produces a working executable called signal.
The fifth file is the doxygen project settings file, Doxyfile, that is generated by the doxygen program when run for the first time.

All code must be properly commented using Doxygen and correct.

Lab Two - Rendezvous
Using the Semaphore class create a program that demonstrates the Rendezvous pattern.  AS before (and always) you must also incldue the Doxygen settings file and a Makefile.  The makefile must now also include a “clean” rule that deletes all .o files from the project.

Lab Three – Mutual Exclusion
Using the Semaphore class create a program that demonstrates Mutual Exclusion. You must  incldue the Doxygen settings file and a Makefile.  The makefile must now also include a “clean” rule that deletes all .o files from the project and a debug option that allows use of the gdb debugger.
